This project focuses on developing comprehensive control software for managing the PTR 237 pressure gauge system using the STM32 microcontroller. The primary objective is to create software enabling control over the pressure gauge, activation via digital signal, and decoding and display of pressure readings on a graphical touchscreen display.

The software, written in C/C++, utilizes advanced STM32 microcontroller features, ensuring efficient and reliable device control. The project fulfills all initial requirements, including the development of a user-friendly interface and algorithms for safeguarding the pressure gauge against damage.

The software underwent thorough testing to validate its functionalities, including pressure measurement behavior at the operational limits. The project delivers a complete solution for controlling and monitoring the PTR 237 pressure gauge, meeting all specified requirements while ensuring high performance and user-friendly operation.
